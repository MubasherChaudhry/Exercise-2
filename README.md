# Exercise-2
If/Else statements


Coding Challenge #2
Use the BMI example from Challenge #1, and the code you already wrote, and
improve it.
Your tasks:
1. Print a nice output to the console, saying who has the higher BMI. The message
is either "Mack's BMI is higher than Mobi's!" or "Mobi's BMI is higher than Mack's!"
2. Use a template literal to include the BMI values in the outputs. Example: "Mack's
BMI (28.3) is higher than Mobi's (23.9)!"
Hint: Use an if/else statement
